3. Design and Implementation
============================

Intro
-----

Once the data structures are laid out, the algorithms tend to fall into place, and the coding is completely easy.
   This point of view is oversimplified but not misleading.

In the previous chapter we examined the basic data-structures that are the building blocks of most programs.
In this chapter we will combine such structures as we work through the design and implementation of a modest-sized program.
We will show::

   1. how the problem influences the data-structures,
   #. how the code that follows is straightforward once we have the data structures mapped out.
